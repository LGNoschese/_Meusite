            Hi, my name is Lu√≠s Gustavo Noschese I am 51 years old, I have been working since I was </br>
            16 years old with sales, architecture and interior projects, but currently observing the </br>
            growth in the internet sales marquet, I understood that I needed to migrate to another </br>
            area, therefore, I made an analysis of the most promising markets and identified that </br>
            the information tecnology market continues to grow and the lack of professionals is very </br>
            large, with a high demand for vacancies in the future and with few professionals.
